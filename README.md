This project utilizes a database on CodeSandbox and allows the user to handle their shopping list.
User can ADD, EDIT, and DELETE items on their shopping list.

## User Stories

```
AS A coffee shop manager
I WANT TO keep a digital shopping list that multiple users can access
SO THAT my employees can update the store needs and I can make the purchases

AS A college student
I WANT TO be able to share my shopping list with my parents
SO THAT they can help my budget my money appropriately for purchases

AS A person preparing for the holidays
I WANT TO be able to keep track of presents to be purchased/have already been purchased
SO THAT my partner and I don't double up on gifts for others
```
## Future

In the future, I will have fewer Github issues...and (as always) will continue to work towards better functionality and a faster process.
